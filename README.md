### 🎉 A Bit About Me
Hi there! I'm a passionate 23-year-old student and frontend developer with a focus on building innovative and engaging digital experiences. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science and working part-time at a dynamic startup called **CLYE**.
When I'm not coding through the night (often indulging in cheese 🧀 and my favorite TV series📺), I'm probably hanging out with my cat🐄, dreaming of a technological utopia. I believe in technology's power to create better connections, structure, and ultimately, a more organized and happy world.
I'm committed to continuous learning and love sharing my knowledge with others. Some of my repositories are featured in [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hooked0nTech) where I share my coding journey.
