### 🚀 Featured Project: [Hooked0nTech](https://github.com/AnnaH00k/hooked0ntech)
My repository **Hooked0nTech** serves as the foundation for my personal landing page, where I showcase my latest projects, experiment with new technologies, and share some coding shenanigans. Whether it's a tutorial, a project showcase, or an exploration of cutting-edge technology, you'll find it here!

### 🎓 Learning & Teaching
I'm committed to continuous learning and love sharing my knowledge with others. Some of my repositories are featured in [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hooked0nTech) where I share my coding journey. I'm also eager to contribute to open-source projects and create repositories that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech.

### 🎉 A Bit About Me
When I'm not coding through the night (often indulging in cheese 🧀 and my favorite TV series📺), I'm probably hanging out with my cat🐄, dreaming of a technological utopia. I believe in technology's power to create better connections, structure, and ultimately, a more organized and happy world.
