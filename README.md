## Welcome to My GitHub! ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=AnnaH00k&color=blueviolet&style=flat-square)

Hi there! I'm a passionate 23-year-old student and frontend developer with a focus on building innovative and engaging digital experiences. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science and working part-time at a dynamic startup called **CLYE**. My coding journey spans across languages like **Swift** and **Java**, but lately, I've been diving deep into the powerful stack of **Next.js, TypeScript,** and **Tailwind CSS**.

### ðŸš€ Featured Project: [Hooked0nTech](https://github.com/AnnaH00k/hooked0ntech)
My repository **Hooked0nTech** serves as the foundation for my personal landing page, where I showcase my latest projects, experiment with new technologies, and share some coding shenanigans. Whether it's a tutorial, a project showcase, or an exploration of cutting-edge technology, you'll find it here!

### ðŸŽ“ Learning & Teaching
I'm committed to continuous learning and love sharing my knowledge with others. Some of my repositories are featured in [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@hooked0nTech) where I share my coding journey. I'm also eager to contribute to open-source projects and create repositories that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech.

### ðŸŽ‰ A Bit About Me
When I'm not coding through the night (often indulging in cheese and my favorite TV series), I'm probably hanging out with my cat, dreaming of a technological utopia. I believe in technology's power to create better connections, structure, and ultimately, a more organized and happy world.
